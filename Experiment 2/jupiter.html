        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
        System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times
        that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly
        less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun
        at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86
        years. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's
        night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since
        prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of
        ancient Roman religion.
